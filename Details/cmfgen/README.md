In "theorry, the procedure here
is intended to work as follows:

The user can either work directrly in
the data release repository or copy
everythin to somewhere else and work 
from their.

To make a new version of the models
one simply runs Regress, with some
version of python. 

In the normal manner, one will get
ouputs in a directory which 
includes the dates.

Next, one runs the routine GetResults.
This will move items from the wherever
the regression outpust went 
to the reults repository.

GetResults can be run either from
the data-release directory or 
from ones local directory.
