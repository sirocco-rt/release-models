This is a directory for computing tardis models, for comparison to Python models of a similar type

The assumption is that one already has tardis installed:

There are two Jupyter notebooks

* tardis\_quidkstart.ipynb - This is simply taken from the Tardis documentation and can be used to dedetermine whether one has tardi properly installed.
* tardis\_python\_compare.ipynb - This is a notebook intended to run models for PYthon domparions


Tardis inputs are in the from of yml files:

* 19ewu.yml - A file available from the tardis repository that is similar to what we want
* python.yml - Nominally the model we want to use for comparisons
* stuart.yml - One provided by Stuart
* tardis\_example.yml - An example
