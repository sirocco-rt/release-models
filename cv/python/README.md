This directory contains models of CVs that are made/being made
for the release paper. The models should not be run in the 
repository, rather one should copy this directory to another
location.  

The models can be run with regression.py (or the Regress
command in this directory).  Once one is satisfied with
the runs, the routine GetResults is intended to allow
one to get the results that are needed for figures.

Of course, if any of the input .pf files changes these
need to be moved separately to test\_cv directory
