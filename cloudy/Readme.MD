These directories are intended for cloudy comparisons:

* python  A directory that has routines to run python grids (at present this is just for macro atom modesls.  Depending
on the way the primary script is run, one can produce grids for a single ionization cycle or grids where the temperature
is alllowed to converg
* cloudy  A directory for running fixed temperature cloudy models (which at present are 10000 degre models)
* cloudy\_converge A directory for running cloudy models which are allowed to converg
* compare A directory for producing plots of comparsions
